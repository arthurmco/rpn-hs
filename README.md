# rpn.hs

Reverse polish notation calculator made in Haskell. Very simple.

This repo was made for

 - testing my Haskell knowledge
 - also test GPG commit signing

Also, every programmer nowadays has at least one repository with 
functional programming code. :wink: 

Partially based on [this
one](http://learnyouahaskell.com/functionally-solving-problems#reverse-polish-notation-calculator).
